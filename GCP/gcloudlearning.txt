Note : 

Resources that live in a zone are referred to as zonal resources. Virtual machine instances and persistent disks live 
in a zone. If you want to attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, both resources must be in the same zone.
Similarly, if you want to assign a static IP address to an instance, the instance must be in the same region as
the static IP address.
